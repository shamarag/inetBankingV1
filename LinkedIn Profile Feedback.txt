Please see below feedback on your LinkedIn Profile.

- Profile Pic -  The ideal LinkedIn profile picture is a proper headshot that shows off your face from the shoulders up. Your profile pic should sell your professional image.

- About Section - Please improve the "About" section by adding 2 to 3 paragraphs describing, your core skills, education, experience and your career objective. At the end include a statement with a call to action. Your call to action statement should  welcome the person to get in touch with you for career opportunities.
e.g. I look forward to connect with you...bla bla

- Headline - I would suggest not to indicate the current job role in the headline as it's not directly related to your course of study. I presume you are looking for opportunities in the IT field, hence include some catchy phrases to indicate your passion and what you aspire to be.
e.g. Aspiring <Software Developer??> | Passionate in Full stack and Web Development | Seeking Fulltime Opportunities | Java/PHP/ <mention any other languages or technologies you are skilled in>

- Work experience - For each of the job roles you have held, provide at least 3-4 key responsibilities/ achievements of the role.

- Education - Try to include the key units you have completed for the master's degree you have got. This is useful evidence to prove that you have studied the areas that are required for your potential job.
This can be added in the description of the master's degree.
e.g. Course Highlights: Object Oriented Programming, Web Developement etc..

- Add more skills pertaining to the field of software development. Such as Software Analysis and Design, OOP, Web Development, 
-Try to add a couple of more software projects. Provide the name, description, technologies/ tools used and the key outcomes.

-Finally, try to ask for recommendations from former employers.

Address these before next week's presentation. You may need to demonstrate your Linkedin profile as a part of it.
